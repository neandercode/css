                    <p1>Web Designer</p1>
                    <img class="web" src="images/spider-web.jpeg">
                    <p>This is a fairly new hobby for me. So far it is very fun and exciting. One day, I hope to become a professional web designer and maybe later on down the line, try my hand at making video games. My entire youth was dedicated to video games such as Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros, God of War or anything with a great story.</p>
                    <p1>Carpet Cleaning</p1>
                    <img class="rug" src="images/rug.jpeg">
                    <p>This has been my professional field since the dawn of my 20s. With over a decade in the field, I have seen it all. The process of getting a floor from dirty to clean has never gotten old. One day, I hope to own a small business to do it in my free time.</p>
                    <p1>Decent Drummer</p1>
                    <img class="drums" src="images/drums.jpeg">
                    <p>My first passion I came across when I was 14 years old. I still remember the christmas my Mom took my brother and I to Guitar Center to pick out our very first instruments. Mine was a Gregg's Percussion. A simple 5 piece with a high hat and crash. My brother and I would jam 8 days a week trying to recreate sounds of Killswitch Engage or any other metalcore sound (yes, its still a great genre). </p>
                    <p1>Lover of all God's Creatures</p1>
                    <img class="kitty" src="images/kitty.jpeg">
                    <p>This isn't as much of a skill as it is a love of mine. Animals have been a huge love since my childhood. In our childhood, my brother, sister and I always took in stray cats to call our own. They taught me the importance of empathy and how to really communicate with animals without the need for a voice. </p>
